Make a program that matches gifts to kids based on age, naughty or nice, and cost off of a budget.
Gifts - name, min age, max age, cost, days for elves to make (hocky stick = 5 days).
Inputs - files, date, budget.
One gift per child.
Naughty young kids get gifts before nice old kids. Cut old kids (>=15 naughty no present) (Then take of older nice kids).
Output - list to a text file, name and a present, how much money total and how much is left over.
